# Project: Property search engine - Assembler School

Deployed version of this project is hosted at Heroku:
* **Node API -> https://lookhaus-api.herokuapp.com/**
* **Laravel APP -> http://laravel-property-search-engine.herokuapp.com/**
* **jS APP -> https://lookhausjs.herokuapp.com/**

In this project you will create a WEB API and two web applications that consume that API. You must create an infrastructure about a property search engine. Being a team project, they can collaborate with the rest of their partners assuming the different roles to carry out the development of the project.

![Team organisation](https://iili.io/JfOFn4.png)

- Develop a REST API for delivering data.
- Develop a Laravel APP for displaying the data comming from the API.
- Develop a jS APP for displaying the data comming from the API.

## Project Organisation
The initial organisation document has to reflect the way in which the project is going to be developed. The main goal is to prevent comments like:
- I'm on 4/5 day and I'm not sure on how to technically carry out this project.
- I haven't talked to any collegue about this project yet.
- I have several questions on the project and I haven't cleared them out in time to finish the project.
- All the organisation is in my mind but I don't know who to write it down.
- I asume I have enough time to do de project in time and because of that, I decide to work on non related project and in the end, I don't have time enough.
- I din't take into account the events and masterclasses that have been going on during the week.
- I didn't take into account the chance of something going wrong on my initial organisation plan.
- I didn't know that the project had to cover some feature.
- One certain feature took so much time that prevented me from carrying out the whole of the project.

## To take into account
In order to avoid the previous kind of behavious, the first part of the project will be to obtain a document that reflects how the project is going to be carried out. That's why it's so important that the Project Manager (hereinafter PM) and the team define what tasks have to develop by each member of the team taking into account that the following requirements have to be properly followed.

PM:
- Coordination within the team
- Task supervision
- Conflict resolution
- The plan has to be properly followed
- Convey possible incidents to Assembler team if required
- Team leadership
- Define appointments with date, time and objectives
- Decision making
- Leader the communication within teams
- Pick up feedback from the team
- Design use cases
- Database design
- API design (create POSTMAN / SWAGGER collection)
- Wireframing APP
- Research on possible technologies, libraries and features
- Planning fases and tasks
- Estimate time of the project development. Assembler team will validate the estimation.
- Hosting and deployment
- Design how the different applications will be deployed to Heroku

IMPORTANT: It won't be allowed to imnplement nor develop any feature of the project during the organisation phase. It's important to understand that the development phase will depend 100% on its organisation and it will have to be validated by the Assembler Team.

## Consulting company
During this project we are going to include a consulting compant that will be in charge of developing orders from the other two teams. Teams will be in charge of providing the consultancy team with proper briefings so that they can develop those tasks.

The PM of the consultancy team will be in charge of:
- Coordinating the orders and requests received, assign a cost in time and, delivery date and decide who is gonna be in charge of developing tasks.
- Supervising the results form the consulting team
- Supervise that the work carried out is done within the agreed budget
- Verify that the work carried out is always verified by PM.
- Resolve conflicts
- Handle contingencies
- The consultancy company starts with 0€ and at the end of the project they must have an approximate amount of 3,600€


## Communication
![Team organisation](https://iili.io/JfGGtI.png)
- Teams cannot reach out one another. Only PMs can talk to other PMs.
- The consultancy company will not carry out any commission that is not properly defined, otherwise it will assume the costs.
- The consulting company may offer services and developments knowing the requirements of the project, so it may resell developments.
- Doubts within the team must be managed by team's PM.
